    q: "My kids won't sit still. Is that okay?",

    q: "When is the best time for outdoor family photos?",

                <p>
                  A session with me looks like your family being your family:
                  walking through a park, sitting on a blanket, kids running
                  ahead, someone tickling someone, everyone laughing. I guide you
                  gently (&ldquo;walk toward me,&rdquo; &ldquo;whisper something
                  silly to each other&rdquo;) but I never force a pose that
                  doesn&apos;t feel like you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I photograph families throughout Skokie, Evanston, Wilmette, and
                  the North Shore. At parks you already love, in your own backyard,
                  or inside your home where the real life happens. The location
                  should feel natural to your family, not like a backdrop you
                  drove an hour to find.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The photos you get back? They look like your family on your best

              more relaxed coverage and time to capture real moments. The Full
