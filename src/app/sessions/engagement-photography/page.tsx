    q: "When should we take engagement photos?",
    a: "Most couples book 3 to 6 months before the wedding, but there's no wrong time. Some couples do it right after the proposal to capture that fresh excitement. Others wait until closer to the wedding to use the photos for save-the-dates.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if we're awkward in front of a camera?",
    a: "You're in good company. Almost everyone says this. My job is to make you forget the camera is there. I use natural prompts (\"walk toward me,\" \"tell each other something funny,\" \"pretend I'm not here for thirty seconds\") that bring out genuine reactions. By the end, most couples tell me it was actually fun.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can we bring our dog?",
    a: "Absolutely. Dogs are always welcome. They tend to make the best candid moments anyway.",
  },
  {
    q: "What should we wear for engagement photos?",
    a: "Think about what makes you feel confident and comfortable. Coordinate your outfits in complementary tones rather than matching exactly. Avoid busy patterns and distracting logos. I'll send detailed wardrobe guidance once you book.",
  },
  {
    q: "How long until we get our photos back?",
    a: "Galleries are typically delivered within 2 to 3 weeks. You'll receive a private online gallery with full-resolution, edited images and full print rights.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you photograph a surprise proposal?",
    a: "Yes! This is one of my favorite things to shoot. We'll coordinate everything ahead of time. You tell me the spot, the plan, and the timing, and I'll be hidden and ready. You get the real surprise, the real reaction, and beautiful photos of the whole moment. We can do a quick portrait session right after while you're both still on cloud nine.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you also photograph weddings?",
    a: "Weddings aren't my main focus. I specialize in family, newborn, milestone, and event photography. That said, if you love my style and want to talk through what wedding coverage could look like, I'm open to the conversation. Reach out and let's chat.",

                <p>
                  You just got engaged. You&apos;re telling everyone, fielding
                  questions about dates and venues, and somewhere in the
                  excitement you realize: you need photos that actually capture
                  this moment.
                </p>
                <p>That&apos;s what this session is for.</p>
                <p>
                  We&apos;ll spend an hour (or more) at a location you love. A
                  park in Evanston, the Chicago Botanic Garden, downtown
                  Wilmette, your favorite coffee shop. And I&apos;ll photograph
                  you two being you: walking, talking, laughing at each other,
                  holding hands the way you always do. No awkward posing. No
                  Pinterest-perfect staging you&apos;ll cringe at in five years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The photos should feel like the two of you on a really great
                  date where someone happened to be taking beautiful pictures.

                    Planning the proposal itself?
                  </strong>{" "}
                  I do that too. If you&apos;re getting ready to pop the
                  question, I can be hidden at the location capturing the whole
                  thing as it happens: the moment, the surprise, the reaction,
                  all of it. We coordinate everything ahead of time so I&apos;m
                  in position without being seen. Once the secret&apos;s out, we
                  roll right into a portrait session while you&apos;re both
                  still glowing. These are some of my favorite sessions because
                  the emotions are completely real. There&apos;s nothing to
                  pose.

            <p className="text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed mb-6">
              Chicago&apos;s North Shore has some of the most beautiful
              engagement photo locations in the Midwest. A few favorites:
            </p>
            <div className="space-y-5 text-charcoal-light leading-relaxed">
              <p>
                <strong className="text-charcoal font-medium">Parks and gardens</strong>:
                The lush greenery and winding paths at places like the Chicago
                Botanic Garden, Gillson Park in Wilmette, and the Skokie
                Northshore Sculpture Park offer variety in a single session.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong className="text-charcoal font-medium">Downtown charm</strong>:
                Downtown Evanston&apos;s tree-lined streets, local coffee shops,
                and architectural mix give you an urban feel without the
                intensity of downtown Chicago.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong className="text-charcoal font-medium">Waterfront</strong>:
                The lakefront along the North Shore has that timeless, open
                quality, especially at golden hour when the light does all the
                work.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong className="text-charcoal font-medium">Your own spot</strong>:
                Maybe it&apos;s the restaurant where you had your first date.
                Maybe it&apos;s your apartment. If a place matters to your
                story, it belongs in your photos.
              </p>
              <p>
                I&apos;m happy to help you pick a location based on the mood
                you&apos;re going for. I know these spots well and I know where
                the light is best at every time of year.

                  Bring one outfit you feel amazing in. If you want a second
                  look, we can do a quick change mid-session. Coordinate with
                  each other in tone and formality. If one person is in a suit,
                  the other shouldn&apos;t be in ripped jeans. I send wardrobe
                  guidance before the session.

                <p>
                  <strong className="text-charcoal font-medium">Timing</strong>:
                  Golden hour (about an hour before sunset) gives the best
                  light, but overcast days are gorgeous too: soft, even light
                  with no harsh shadows. I&apos;ll recommend the best time for
                  your session date.

                <p>
                  <strong className="text-charcoal font-medium">Nerves are normal.</strong>{" "}
                  Most couples tell me they feel awkward in front of a camera.
                  That feeling usually disappears within the first five minutes.
                  I&apos;ll guide you through natural prompts, things to do
                  together, ways to move, so you&apos;re never standing there

              Engagement sessions start at $200 for a focused 30-minute mini
              session. Most couples choose the Classic session ($325, 60
              minutes) which gives us time to explore a location and capture the
              full range: wide shots, close-ups, candid moments, and those
              portraits you&apos;ll actually want to frame. The Full session
              ($500, 90 minutes) is perfect if you want to include a second
              location or a wardrobe change.
