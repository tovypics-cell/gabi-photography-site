        question: "Do you offer a maternity and newborn package?",
        answer:
          "I book the two sessions together with the same packages rather than a separate bundle price. The value is in holding your newborn date early and having one photographer and one style across both galleries. Ask when you reach out and I will plan both.",
      },
      {
        question: "When should I book maternity and newborn photos?",
        answer:
          "Reach out around 20 weeks. The maternity session happens between 28 and 34 weeks, and I hold a tentative newborn date around your due date that we confirm once the baby arrives.",
      },
      {
        question: "How much do maternity and newborn sessions cost together?",
        answer:
          "Each session runs from $200 to $500 depending on length, so two Classic sessions are $650 and a Classic maternity with a Full newborn session is $825. Edited images and print rights are included in every package.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can both sessions happen at home?",
        answer:
          "Yes. An in-home maternity session by a big window followed by a newborn session at the same window is one of my favorite pairings, especially in late fall and winter when golden hour is short.",
      },
      {
        question: "Where do you photograph maternity and newborn sessions?",
        answer:
          "Throughout Skokie, Evanston, Wilmette, Lincolnwood, Glenview, Northbrook and Chicago's North Shore. Sessions within 10 miles of Skokie carry no travel fee.",
