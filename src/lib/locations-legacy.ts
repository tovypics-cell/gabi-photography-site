      "As a Skokie-based family and newborn photographer, I'm deeply rooted in this community. Skokie is home — it's where I raise my family, where I know every park's best golden hour spot, and where I've built relationships with families who trust me to capture their most meaningful moments.",
      "Skokie offers some of the most beautiful locations for family photography sessions. From the lush green spaces of Emily Oaks Nature Center to the vibrant gardens at the Skokie Northshore Sculpture Park, there's no shortage of stunning natural backdrops right in our neighborhood. I love shooting at Laramie Park during golden hour, where the light filters through the trees in the most magical way.",
      "For families who prefer the comfort and authenticity of home, I specialize in in-home lifestyle sessions throughout Skokie. There's something irreplaceable about capturing your family in your own space — the nursery where you rock your baby to sleep, the kitchen where Saturday morning pancakes happen, the backyard where your kids run wild. These are the real moments that make your family uniquely yours.",

My approach is naturally guided — meaning I'll gently direct without over-posing, letting the real interactions shine through. The result? Photos that feel like your family, not a staged version of it.",

      "Lighthouse Beach and the Evanston lakefront offer some of the most dramatic photography backdrops on the North Shore. The combination of water, sky, and sand creates a timeless setting for family portraits — especially during the golden hour when the light over Lake Michigan is absolutely breathtaking. I've captured families playing in the waves, toddlers discovering sand for the first time, and couples stealing a quiet moment while their kids play nearby.",
      "Beyond the lakefront, Evanston's beautiful parks and green spaces provide lush, natural settings for family sessions. The Shakespeare Garden at Northwestern University is a hidden gem for intimate portraits, while the sprawling grounds of Centennial Park offer room for playful, active family sessions. During fall, the Maple Avenue corridor transforms into a canopy of warm golds and reds — perfect for cozy autumn family photos.",
      "I serve families throughout Evanston's diverse neighborhoods — from the bustling downtown area near Davis Street to the quiet, tree-lined blocks of South Evanston, and the stately homes along Sheridan Road.
