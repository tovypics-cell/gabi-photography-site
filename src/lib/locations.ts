  question: `How much does a family photographer in ${town} cost?`,
  answer: `My sessions start at $250 for a 30-minute mini session and go up to $500 for a 90-minute full session. Every package includes professionally edited images in a private online gallery with full print rights. Sessions within 10 miles of Skokie carry no travel fee.`,

  question: `Do you photograph in-home sessions in ${town}?`,

});
const faqNewbornTiming: Faq = {
  question: "When should I book newborn photos?",
  answer:
    "Reach out during your third trimester, ideally around 30 to 34 weeks, so we can hold a tentative date. The best window for newborn photos is 5 to 14 days after birth, but older newborns photograph beautifully too.",
};
const faqBestTime = (spot: string): Faq => ({
  question: `What is the best time of day for outdoor family photos in ${spot}?`,

  question: "What if my kids will not cooperate?",

    "That is completely normal and it is planned for. I gently guide instead of posing, we take breaks when someone needs one, and the wiggly, silly, in-between moments are usually the photos families end up framing.",
